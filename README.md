# Contact List v. 0.2

Part of Lighthouse Labs Course

# Objective

Implement a simple app to offer basic contact list functionality using ruby Classes.

# Implementation

An improvement over an initial build which was unable to save data. In this implementation, added a csv file to act as a database for the application.
Users interact with the app through the terminal using ARGV (argument vector) to specify the task they would like to perform. For this implementation, the features I managed to build include:

* Create a new contact
* List all contacts
* Show a contact (based on id)
* Search for a user (match either name or email)
